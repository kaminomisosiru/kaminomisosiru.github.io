I am a researcher at [Security Assurance Scheme Research Group](https://www.cpsec.aist.go.jp/group/sasrg/){:target="\_blank"} in [Cyber Physical Security Research Institute](https://www.cpsec.aist.go.jp/index_en.html){:target="\_blank"}, [National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html){:target="\_blank"}.
I received my Bachelor's degree in Engineering, Master's degree in Engineering and Ph.D. in Engineering from Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2018, 2020 and 2023, respectively. My adviser is Prof. [Wakaha Ogata](http://www.crypt.ict.e.titech.ac.jp/users/wakaha/index.html){:target="\_blank"}.
Furthermore, I completed Progressive Graduate Minor in Cybersecurity in 2020.
Before I become a resercher at AIST, I worked as a research assistant at AIST from June 2020 to March 2023, and as a [research fellowship for young scientists](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-pd/index.html) from April 2022 to March 2023.

My ambition in life is to realize a secure world. To do that, I'm researching cryptography and information security. I love to systematically analyze security of real-world cryptraphic technologies, and I'm interested in how to promote social implementation of cryptographic technologies. I began studying standardization of technologies and the sociological aspects of cryptography and security.
