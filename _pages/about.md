I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech)](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english){:target="\_blank"}.
I received my Bachelor's degree in Engineering and Master's degree in Engineering from Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2018 and 2020, respectively. I completed Progressive Graduate Minor in Cybersecurity in 2020.
I have been working as a research assistant at [National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html) since June 2020.

I am skilled at provable security in cryptography. My research interests include public-key cryptography, post-quantum cryptography, and secure messaging.

I am a compassionate and cooperative professional.
I wrote a research article for Information Sciences in 2019. I received Outstanding Student Award in 2020, and Tsujii Shigeo Security Award in 2021.
