  abstract  = {Authenticated key exchange (AKE) is a fundamental cryptographic protocol that establishes a secure channel over the Internet. The security for AKE is defined as a security game between an adversary and the challenger. Especially, partners and freshness of the session are used to identify trivial attacks by the adversary. Roughly, partners are instances that derive the same session key, and freshness determines whether an adversary's behavior constitutes trivial attacks. In this work, we reconsider security definitions for AKE and point out the shortcomings of the conventional partners and freshness definition. Then, we propose a new robust and strong security definition. First, we propose a new definition of partners based on round identifiers. Second, we propose a new freshness definition, which captures more non-trivial attacks than the conventional ones. We introduce a new notion of miscommunicators to identify the adversary's behavior more accurately than conventional definitions. This allows, for example, the behavior of sending the first message as-is and tampering with the second message to be viewed as a non-trivial attack, which was considered a trivial attack in conventional definitions. Our new security definition is strictly stronger than the conventional one. As evidence of this, we provide a new construction of AKE that is secure in the conventional definition but insecure in the new definition.},

  abstract  = {This paper is a report on how we tackled constructing a digital signature scheme whose multi-user security with corruption can be tightly reduced to search assumptions. First, We reveal two new properties of signature schemes whose security cannot be tightly reduced to standard assumptions. More precisely, we generalize the negative result of Pan and Wagner, which shows that the reduction loss of the concrete signature scheme, called the Parallel-OR signature scheme, is lower bounded by the number of users. From this negative result, we have precious knowledge about designing a signature scheme that is tightly secure in multi-user settings with corruption. Next, we show a concrete construction of signature schemes based on the first result. Our scheme's multi-user security can be reduced to the CDH assumption, and the reduction loss does not depend on the number of users, but, unfortunately, the loss linearly depends on the number of random oracle queries issued by the adversary. So, it remains open whether we can construct a signature scheme whose multi-user security with corruption can be tightly reduced to search assumptions.},

  abstract  = {Registration-based encryption (RBE) is a solution for the key-escrow problem in identity-based encryption. Initial RBE schemes are too theoretical and inefficient, but recent advances make RBE schemes efficient enough to be incorporated into real-world systems. On the other hand, from a security point of view, existing schemes are insufficient for such systems because they only consider CPA security. Recently, Glaeser et al. (ACM CCS'23) presented a solution to this problem. They suggested the usage of the original Fujisaki-Okamoto (FO) transformation (CRYPTO'99) to realize CCA-secure RBE. However, they did not provide its formal analysis because they considered it can be applied in a straightforward manner. In this work, we reveal that the FO transformation for RBE is non-trivial, and provide an appropriate one suitable to RBE. The essence of achieving CCA security through FO transformation is that the receiver verifies that the received ciphertext is correctly generated by re-encryption. In RBE, we find that the sender and receiver must share the public parameter used for encryption since the decryption algorithm does not take it by default. Therefore, we make the sender explicitly send the current public parameter as part of the ciphertext. Furthermore, we show that a sufficiently large min-entropy of ciphertexts (so-called well-spreadness) is necessary to apply the FO transformation to RBE, in contrast to PKE or IBE. This property guarantees that no information is leaked from the decryption oracle even if the public parameter in the ciphertext is replaced. Based on these observations, we propose a new FO transformation tailored to RBE, which allows existing CPA-secure RBE schemes to be transformed into CCAsecure ones correctly.},

In short, MLS leaks much more _metadata_ than Signal.

We then propose an efficient and provably secure solution to bootstrap the current MLS to be as metadata-hiding (or, in some metrics, even more) as Signal. Our key insight is to leverage the existence of a unique continuously evolving group secret key shared by the group to perform an anonymous membership authentication protocol.},

  abstract  = {The past year has marked significant progress in secure messaging technologies. In March 2023, the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol was standardized by the IETF, followed by Signal's introduction in May 2023 of PQXDH, a post-quantum alternative to the X3DH handshake. In the first part of this presentation, we identify scalability challenges that may hinder the widespread adoption of MLS and Signal in a post-quantum context, particularly in regions with limited mobile data plans. This analysis is backed by real-world quantitative data. In the second part of this talk, we propose a novel protocol with improved bandwidth consumption. It incorporates efficient post-quantum primitives, specifically multi-recipient public key encryption (mPKEs), optimized for secure messaging. We anticipate that our approach will be an order of magnitude more efficient than direct adaptations of existing protocols in practical scenarios.}

  abstract  = {Secure group messaging (SGM) protocols allow large groups of users to communicate in a secure and asynchronous manner. In recent years, continuous group key agreements (CGKAs) have provided a powerful abstraction to reason on the security properties we expect from SGM protocols. While robust techniques have been developed to protect the contents of conversations in this context, it is in general more challenging to protect metadata (e.g. the identity and social relationships of group members), since their knowledge is often needed by the server in order to ensure the proper function of the SGM protocol.

               <br><br>In this work, we provide a simple and generic wrapper protocol that upgrades non-metadata-hiding CGKAs into metadata-hiding CGKAs. Our key insight is to leverage the existence of a unique continuously evolving group secret key shared among the group members.
               We use this key to perform a group membership authentication protocol that convinces the server in an anonymous manner that a user is a legitimate group member. Our technique only uses a standard signature scheme, and thus, the wrapper protocol can be instantiated from a wide range of assumptions, including post-quantum ones. It is also very efficient, as it increases the bandwidth cost of the underlying CGKA operations by at most a factor of two.

               <br><br>To formally prove the security of our protocol, we use the universal composability (UC) framework and model a new ideal functionality F^mh_CGKA capturing the correctness and security guarantee of metadata-hiding CGKA. To capture the above intuition of a ``wrapper'' protocol, we also define a restricted ideal functionality F^ctxt_CGKA, which roughly captures a non-metadata-hiding CGKA. We then show that our wrapper protocol UC-realizes F^mh_CGKA in the F^ctxt_CGKA-hybrid model, which in particular formalizes the intuition that any non-metadata-hiding CGKA can be modularly bootstrapped into metadata-hiding CGKA.},

  abstract  = {Continuous group key agreements (CGKAs) are a class of protocols that can provide strong security guarantees to secure group messaging protocols such as Signal and MLS. Protection against device compromise is provided by commit messages: at a regular rate, each group member may refresh their key material by uploading a commit message, which is then downloaded and processed by all the other members. In practice, propagating commit messages dominates the bandwidth consumption of existing CGKAs.

               <br><br>We propose Chained CmPKE, a CGKA with an asymmetric bandwidth cost: in a group of N members, a commit message costs O(N) to upload and O(1) to download, for a total bandwidth cost of O(N). In contrast, TreeKEM [19, 24, 76] costs Ω(logN)in both directions, for a total cost Ω(NlogN). Our protocol relies on generic primitives, and is therefore readily post-quantum.

               <br><br>We go one step further and propose post-quantum primitives that are tailored to Chained CmPKE, which allows us to cut the growth rate of uploaded commit messages by two or three orders of magnitude compared to naive instantiations. Finally, we realize a software implementation of Chained CmPKE. Our experiments show that even for groups with a size as large as N=2^10, commit messages can be computed and processed in less than 100 ms.},

  abstract  = {Threshold public-key encryption (threshold PKE) has various useful applications. A lot of threshold PKE schemes are proposed based on RSA, Diffie-Hellman and lattice, but to the best of our knowledge, code-based threshold PKEs have not been proposed. In this paper, we provide three IND-CCA secure code-based threshold PKE schemes. The first scheme is the concrete instantiation of Dodis-Katz conversion (Dodis and Katz, TCC'05) that converts an IND-CCA secure PKE into an IND-CCA secure threshold PKE using parallel encryption and a signature scheme. This approach provides non-interactive threshold decryption, but ciphertexts are large (about 16 kilobytes for 128-bit security) due to long code-based signatures even in the state-of-the-art one. The second scheme is a new parallel encryption-based construction without signature schemes. Unlike the Dodis-Katz conversion, our parallel encryption converts an OW-CPA secure PKE into an OW-CPA secure threshold PKE. To enhance security, we use Cong et al.'s conversion (Cong et al., ASIACRYPT'21). Thanks to eliminating signatures, its ciphertext is 512 bytes, which is only 3\% of the first scheme. The decryption process needs an MPC for computing hash functions, but decryption of OW-CPA secure PKE can be done locally. The third scheme is an MPC-based threshold PKE scheme from code-based assumption. We take the same approach Cong et al.\ took to construct efficient lattice-based threshold PKEs. We build an MPC for the decryption algorithm of OW-CPA secure Classic McEliece PKE. This scheme has the shortest ciphertext among the three schemes at just 192 bytes. Compared to the regular CCA secure Classic McEliece PKE, the additional ciphertext length is only 100 bytes. The cons are heavy distributed computation in the decryption process.},

A compact aggregate signature, where the size does not depend on the aggregate number, is desirable when the objective is to reduce storage cost and bandwidth. However, in conventional compact CLAS schemes, aggregation of signatures is restricted. The state information is meant to be used only once for security; it is generally used to restrict aggregation to signatures generated with the same state information. This paper proposes the first unrestricted and compact CLAS scheme where the signature size is constant and any combination of signatures can be aggregated. Aside from convenient storage and communication costs, our scheme is also equipped with a secure system against realistic adversaries. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of our CLAS scheme and demonstrate its effectiveness. Finally, this paper reveals that it is not possible to construct an unrestricted and compact CLAS scheme for a widely used structure with constant pairing computation.},

  abstract     = {Identity-based matchmaking encryption (IB-ME) [Ateniese et al. Crypto 2019] allows users to communicate privately in an anonymous and authenticated manner. After the seminal paper by Ateniese et al., a lot of work has been done on the security and construction of IB-ME. In this work, we revisit the security definitions of IB-ME and provide improved constructions of it. First, we classify the existing security notions of IB-ME, systematically categorizing privacy into three categories (CPA, CCA, and privacy in the case of mismatch) and authenticity into four categories (NMA and CMA both against insiders and outsiders).In particular, we reconsider the privacy when the sender's identity is mismatched during decryption, and provide a new simple security game, called mismatch security, capturing the essence of it. Second, we propose efficient and strongly secure IB-ME schemes from the bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model and from anonymous identity-based encryption, identity-based signature, and reusable extractors in the standard model. The first scheme is based on Boneh-Franklin IBE similar to the Ateniese et al. scheme, but ours achieves a more compact decryption key and ciphertext and stronger CCA-privacy, CMA-authenticity, and mismatch security. The second scheme is an improved generic construction, which active not only stronger security but also the shortest ciphertext among existing generic constructions.  Through this construction, we obtain, for example, a more efficient scheme from the symmetric external Diffie-Hellman assumption in the standard model, and a practical scheme from lattices in the quantum random oracle model.},
