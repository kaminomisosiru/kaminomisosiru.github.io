  abstract  = {This paper is a report on how we tackled constructing a digital signature scheme whose multi-user security with corruption can be tightly reduced to search assumptions. 
First, we reveal the new requirements of signature schemes that never have tight security.  
More precisely, we generalize the negative result of Pan and Wagner in PKC 2022, which shows that the reduction loss of concrete construction of the signature scheme is lower bounded by the number of users. 
From this negative result, we have precious knowledge about designing a signature scheme with such a desired security. 
Next, we show a concrete construction of signature schemes based on the first result. 
Our scheme's multi-user security can be reduced to the CDH assumption, and the reduction loss does not depend on the number of users, but, unfortunately, the loss linearly depends on the number of random oracle queries issued by the adversary.
So, it remains open whether we can construct a signature scheme whose multi-user security with corruption can be tightly reduced to search assumptions.

In short, MLS leaks much more _metadata_ than Signal. In privacy-critical scenarios, dismissing this metadata leakage puts at risk the users who may otherwise believe that MLS offers the exact same level of security as Signal. We then propose an efficient and provably secure solution to bootstrap the current MLS to be as metadata-hiding (or, in some metrics, even more) as Signal. Our key insight is to leverage the existence of a unique continuously evolving group secret key shared by the group to perform an anonymous membership authentication protocol.},

  abstract  = {Secure group messaging (SGM) protocols allow large groups of users to communicate in a secure and asynchronous manner. In recent years, continuous group key agreements (CGKAs) have provided a powerful abstraction to reason on the security properties we expect from SGM protocols. While robust techniques have been developed to protect the contents of conversations in this context, it is in general more challenging to protect metadata (e.g. the identity and social relationships of group members), since their knowledge is often needed by the server in order to ensure the proper function of the SGM protocol.

  <br><br>In this work, we provide a simple and generic wrapper protocol that upgrades non-metadata-hiding CGKAs into metadata-hiding CGKAs. Our key insight is to leverage the existence of a unique continuously evolving group secret key shared among the group members.
  We use this key to perform a group membership authentication protocol that convinces the server in an anonymous manner that a user is a legitimate group member. Our technique only uses a standard signature scheme, and thus, the wrapper protocol can be instantiated from a wide range of assumptions, including post-quantum ones. It is also very efficient, as it increases the bandwidth cost of the underlying CGKA operations by at most a factor of two.

  <br><br>To formally prove the security of our protocol, we use the universal composability (UC) framework and model a new ideal functionality F^mh_CGKA capturing the correctness and security guarantee of metadata-hiding CGKA. To capture the above intuition of a ``wrapper'' protocol, we also define a restricted ideal functionality F^ctxt_CGKA, which roughly captures a non-metadata-hiding CGKA. We then show that our wrapper protocol UC-realizes F^mh_CGKA in the F^ctxt_CGKA-hybrid model, which in particular formalizes the intuition that any non-metadata-hiding CGKA can be modularly bootstrapped into metadata-hiding CGKA.},

  abstract  = {Continuous group key agreements (CGKAs) are a class of protocols that can provide strong security guarantees to secure group messaging protocols such as Signal and MLS. Protection against device compromise is provided by commit messages: at a regular rate, each group member may refresh their key material by uploading a commit message, which is then downloaded and processed by all the other members. In practice, propagating commit messages dominates the bandwidth consumption of existing CGKAs.

  <br><br>We propose Chained CmPKE, a CGKA with an asymmetric band- width cost: in a group of N members, a commit message costs O(N) to upload and O(1) to download, for a total bandwidth cost of O(N). In contrast, TreeKEM [19, 24, 76] costs Ω(logN)in both directions, for a total cost Ω(NlogN). Our protocol relies on generic primitives, and is therefore readily post-quantum.

  <br><br>We go one step further and propose post-quantum primitives that are tailored to Chained CmPKE, which allows us to cut the growth rate of uploaded commit messages by two or three orders of magnitude compared to naive instantiations. Finally, we realize a software implementation of Chained CmPKE. Our experiments show that even for groups with a size as large as N=2^10, commit messages can be computed and processed in less than 100 ms.},

  abstract  = {Threshold public-key encryption (threshold PKE) has various useful applications. A lot of threshold PKE schemes are proposed based on RSA, Diffie-Hellman and lattice, but to the best of our knowledge, code-based threshold PKEs have not been proposed. In this paper, we provide three IND-CCA secure code-based threshold PKE schemes. The first scheme is the concrete instantiation of Dodis-Katz conversion (Dodis and Katz, TCC'05) that converts an IND-CCA secure PKE into an IND-CCA secure threshold PKE using parallel encryption and a signature scheme. This approach provides non-interactive threshold decryption, but ciphertexts are large (about 16 kilobytes for 128-bit security) due to long code-based signatures even in the state-of-the-art one. The second scheme is a new parallel encryption-based construction without signature schemes. Unlike the Dodis-Katz conversion, our parallel encryption converts an OW-CPA secure PKE into an OW-CPA secure threshold PKE. To enhance security, we use Cong et al.'s conversion (Cong et al., ASIACRYPT'21). Thanks to eliminating signatures, its ciphertext is 512 bytes, which is only 3\% of the first scheme. The decryption process needs an MPC for computing hash functions, but decryption of OW-CPA secure PKE can be done locally. The third scheme is an MPC-based threshold PKE scheme from code-based assumption. We take the same approach Cong et al.\ took to construct efficient lattice-based threshold PKEs. We build an MPC for the decryption algorithm of OW-CPA secure Classic McEliece PKE. This scheme has the shortest ciphertext among the three schemes at just 192 bytes. Compared to the regular CCA secure Classic McEliece PKE, the additional ciphertext length is only 100 bytes. The cons are heavy distributed computation in the decryption process.},

  abstract  = {A certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) scheme employing a reduced signature size eliminates the complexity of certificate management in a traditional public key cryptosystem. A compact aggregate signature, where the size does not depend on the aggregate number, is desirable when the objective is to reduce storage cost and bandwidth. However, in conventional compact CLAS schemes, aggregation of signatures is restricted. The state information is meant to be used only once for security; it is generally used to restrict aggregation to signatures generated with the same state information. This paper proposes the first unrestricted and compact CLAS scheme where the signature size is constant and any combination of signatures can be aggregated. Aside from convenient storage and communication costs, our scheme is also equipped with a secure system against realistic adversaries. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of our CLAS scheme and demonstrate its effectiveness. Finally, this paper reveals that it is not possible to construct an unrestricted and compact CLAS scheme for a widely used structure with constant pairing computation.},

  abstract     = {Identity-based matchmaking encryption (IB-ME) [Ateniese et al. Crypto 2019] allows users to communicate privately in an anonymous and authenticated manner. After the seminal paper by Ateniese et al., a lot of work has been done on the security and construction of IB-ME.In this work, we revisit the security definitions and construction of IB-ME and provide the following three contributions.

  -- First, we embark on the task of classifying the existing security notions of IB-ME. We systematically categorize privacy into three core categories (CPA, CCA, and privacy in the case of mismatch) and authenticity into four categories (NMA and CMA both against insiders and outsiders). In particular, we reconsider privacy when the sender's identity is mismatched during decryption, considered as ``enhanced privacy''~[Francati et al., INDOCRYPT 2021], and provide a new simple security game, called mismatch security, that captures the essence of it. This structured framework not only facilitates more precise comparisons between different IB-ME schemes, but also serves as a valuable tool for evaluating the security of newly proposed schemes.

-- Second, we propose a highly efficient and strongly secure IB-ME scheme from the bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model. The scheme is based on the Ateniese et al. scheme, but we introduce several techniques to improve its security and efficiency. Especially, we found that the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation enhances not only privacy but also authenticity. As a result, we obtain a scheme that offers a more compact decryption key and ciphertext than the Ateniese et al. scheme, while achieving CCA and CMA, and mismatch security.

-- Third, we propose a new generic construction of IB-ME from anonymous identity-based encryption, identity-based signature, and reusable extractors. Our construction not only achieves CCA, CMA, and mismatch security, but is also the most efficient among existing generic constructions. Through this construction, we obtain various IB-ME schemes from both classical and post-quantum assumptions. For example, we obtain a more efficient scheme from the symmetric external Diffie-Hellman assumption in the standard model, and a practical scheme from lattices in the quantum random oracle model whose secret keys and ciphertexts are less than 5 kilobytes. Moreover, our generic construction produces the first pairing-free IB-ME scheme in the standard model and the first tightly secure lattice-based IB-ME scheme in the quantum random oracle model.},
